This immersive program is one of a kind in San Antonio , and will help you land a job in Glassdoor ’ s #1 Best Job in America.\\nData Science is a method of providing actionable intelligence from data. The data revolution has hit San Antonio , resulting in an explosion in Data Scientist positions across companies like USAA , Accenture , Booz Allen Hamilton , and HEB. We ’ ve even seen UTSA invest $ 70 M for a Cybersecurity Center and School of Data Science. We built a program to specifically meet the growing demands of this industry.\\nOur program will be 18 weeks long , full-time , hands-on , and project-based. Our curriculum development and instruction is led by Senior Data Scientist , Maggie Giust , who has worked at HEB , Capital Group , and Rackspace , along with input from dozens of practitioners and hiring partners. Students will work with real data sets , realistic problems , and the entire data science pipeline from collection to deployment. They will receive professional development training in resume writing , interviewing , and continuing education to prepare for a smooth transition to the workforce.\\nWe focus on applied data science for immediate impact and ROI in a business , which is how we can back it all up with a 6 month tuition refund guarantee – just like our existing Web Dev program. We ’ re focusing on Data Science with Python , SQL , and ML , covered in 14 modules : 1 ) Fundamentals ; 2 ) Applied statistics ; 3 ) SQL ; 4 ) Python ; 5 ) Supervised machine learning – regression ; 6 ) Supervised machine learning – classification ; 7 ) Unsupervised machine learning – clustering ; 8 ) Time series analysis ; 9 ) Anomaly detection ; 10 ) Natural language processing ; 11 ) Distributed machine learning ; 12 ) Advanced topics ( deep learning , NoSQL , cloud deployment , etc. ) ; 13 ) Storytelling with data ; and 14 ) Domain expertise development.\\nApplications are now open for Codeup ’ s first Data Science cohort , which will start class on February 4 , 2019. Hurry – there are only 25 seats available ! To further our mission of cultivating inclusive growth , scholarships will be available to women , minorities , LGBTQIA+ individuals , veterans , first responders , and people relocating to San Antonio.\\nIf you want to learn about joining our program or hiring our graduates , email datascience@codeup.com !'"
